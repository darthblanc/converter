# Converter Suite
This suite of programs may be useful in conversions (distance, temperature, currency).  

To utilise this application you need a python installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/.  
You may also need pip: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/.  

There are a few libraries for you to install. So I will outline commands for their installation.
> pip install tqdm  
> pip install pandas  

If you run the GUI.py file you should see:
