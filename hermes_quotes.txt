Now Zeus commands you to send him off with all good speed.
But wait, I can save you, free you from that great danger.
Hermes the guide, the mighty giant-killer, stood there, spellbound.
You are our messenger, Hermes, sent on all our missions.
Now Cyllenian Hermes called away the suitorsâ€™ ghosts...
...so Hermes skimmed the crests on endless crests
Hermes the guide and giant-killer ate and drank.
even a deathless god who came upon that place would gaze in wonder, heart entranced with pleasure...
Destiny still ordains that he shall see his loved ones, reach his high-roofed house, his native land at last.
...this magic herb I give will fight her spells
